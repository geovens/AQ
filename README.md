# AQ for Problem Solving (AQ-PS)

AQ-PS is a fork work of the original Go playing bot [AQ](https://github.com/ymgaq/AQ). AQ-PS is a bot that does not play the game of Go, but solves life and death problems.  
  
AQ-PS is in development, and is currently not good at solving problems of advanced level. So I might only keep it for personal use.

- OS: 64-bit Windows  
- CPU: CPU with SSE 4.2
